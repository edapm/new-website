### Hi!
I'm Ed, a web developer (mostly). So far, I'm (fairly) fluent in Python, HTML and CSS, have a fairly good understanding of Django, and have dabbled in Java, JavaScript and a few other languages.

### Find Me
I'm on GitHub as <a href="https://github.com/edapm">edapm</a>, and some of my code is in an organisation - <a href="https://github.com/forgenst">The Forgenst Company</a>.
